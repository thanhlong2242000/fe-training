                    The Mission Board of the EU Mission on Cancer has defined Comprehensive Cancer Infrastructures as
                    ‘national or regional infrastructures that provide resources and services to support, improve and
                    integrate cancer care, research, training of care professionals and education for cancer patients,
                    survivors and families/carers.’
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Today, the level of development of Comprehensive Cancer Infrastructures and their capacities, such
                    as their digital, research and innovation-related capacities, vary considerably across Member States
                    and Associated Countries, leading to inequalities, in particular in terms of research, quality and
                    access to care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Horizon Europe Mission on Cancer will complement the set-up across Member States and several
                    Associated Countries of an EU network of Comprehensive Cancer Centres that will be established
                    through the Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan by 2025. The Mission aims to achieve the target of ensuring
                    that 90% of eligible cancer patients have access to Comprehensive Cancer Infrastructures by 2030. In
                    that context, this topic should set up, across Member States and several Associated Countries, a
                    capacity-building programme for countries of the EU network of Comprehensive Cancer Centres to be
                    established through the Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan[1], to support them in improving or developing
                    their existing or future Comprehensive Cancer Infrastructures, focussing on developing their
                    digital, research & innovation-related capacities and their integration with cancer care.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Proposals under this topic should aim at delivering results that are directed at and contributing to
                    all of the following expected outcomes:
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Research and health policy makers will benefit from support to further develop or set up
                    Comprehensive Cancer Infrastructures, leading to improvement in terms of research and access to
                    care;</p>
                <p>Research and healthcare professionals will benefit from a better integration between research and
                    care;</p>

                <p>Researchers will benefit from innovative infrastructures to perform research and participate in
                    studies;</p>

                <p>Citizens, including patients and their caregivers will have enhanced access to screening,
                    diagnostics and treatments, improved care pathways and more integrated care. Their involvement and
                    participation to clinical trials will be facilitated.
                </p>
                <p>Scope:</p>

                <p>Building inter alia on the work carried out in several joint actions[2], the work of organisations
                    in the area of accreditation and certification[3], the work that will be carried out under the
                    Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan[4], as well as existing[5] and potential future mappings, a
                    capacity-building programme should be set up for Member States and several Associated Countries in
                    the EU network of Comprehensive Cancer Centres, to be established through the Europe’s Beating
                    Cancer Plan, in order to help them develop or further improve digital, research & innovation-related
                    capacities of future or existing Comprehensive Cancer Infrastructures.
